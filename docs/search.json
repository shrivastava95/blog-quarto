I’m part of the computer vision research team at Metafusion. Outside of work, I turn double espressos into work that makes vision-language model reason faster and better, for cheaper. I am rated 1705 on codeforces, which puts me in the top 7% of codeforces competitive programmers. I am currently ranked #1 on TensorTonic, a website where you earn points by implementing machine learning algorithms."
